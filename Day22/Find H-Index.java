/*Find H-Index
Given an integer array citations[], where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher received for the ith paper. The task is to find the H-index.
H-Index is the largest value such that the researcher has at least H papers that have been cited at least H times.

Examples:

Input: citations[] = [3, 0, 5, 3, 0]
Output: 3
Explanation: There are at least 3 papers (3, 5, 3) with at least 3 citations.

Input: citations[] = [5, 1, 2, 4, 1]
Output: 2
Explanation: There are 3 papers (with citation counts of 5, 2, and 4) that have 2 or more citations. However, the H-Index cannot be 3 because there aren't 3 papers with 3 or more citations.

Input: citations[] = [0, 0]
Output: 0

Constraints:

1 â‰¤ citations.size() â‰¤ 10^6
0 â‰¤ citations[i] â‰¤ 10^6*/

class Solution {
    // Function to find hIndex
    public int hIndex(int[] citations) {
        // code here
        int n = citations.length;
        int []frequency = new int[n+1];
        
        for(int c : citations){
            frequency[Math.min(c, n)]++;
        }
        
        int count = 0;
        for(int i=n;i>=0;i--){
            count += frequency[i];
            if(count >= i){
                return i;
            }
        }
        return 0;
    }
}
