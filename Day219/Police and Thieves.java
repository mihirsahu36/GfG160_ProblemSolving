/*Police and Thieves
Given an array arr[], where each element contains either a 'P' for policeman or a 'T' for thief.
Find the maximum number of thieves that can be caught by the police. 
Keep in mind the following conditions :
Each policeman can catch only one thief.
A policeman cannot catch a thief who is more than k units away from him.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = ['P', 'T', 'T', 'P', 'T'], k = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: Maximum 2 thieves can be caught.
First policeman catches first thief and second police man can catch either second or third thief.

Input: arr[] = ['T', 'T', 'P', 'P', 'T', 'P'], k = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: Maximum 3 thieves can be caught.

Constraints:

1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ k ≤ 1000
arr[i] = 'P' or 'T' */

class Solution {
    public int catchThieves(char[] arr, int k) {
        // code here
        int n = arr.length;
        int i = 0, j = 0, count = 0;
        
        while(i < n && j < n){
            while(i < n && arr[i] != 'P'){
                i++;
            }
            
            while(j < n && arr[j] != 'T'){
                j++;
            }
            
            if(i < n && j < n && Math.abs(i - j) <= k){
                count++;
                i++;
                j++;
            }else if(j < n && j < i){
                j++;
            }else if(i < n && i < j){
                i++;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
