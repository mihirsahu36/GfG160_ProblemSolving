/* Max DAG Edges
Given a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with V vertices numbered from 0 to V-1 and E edges,
represented as a 2D array edges[][], where each entry edges[i] = [u, v] denotes a directed edge from vertex u to vertex v,
find the maximum number of additional edges that can be added to the graph without forming any cycles.
Note: The resulting graph must remain a DAG, meaning that adding any further edge would not create a cycle.

Examples:

Input: V = 3, E = 2, edges[][] = [[0, 1], [1, 2]]
Output: 1
Explanation: The given DAG allows one more edge, 0 -> 2, which keeps the structure acyclic.
Adding anything else would create a cycle.

Input: V = 4, E = 4, edges[][] = [[0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 2], [2, 3]]
Output: 2
Explanation: Two additional edges (0 -> 3, 1 -> 3) can be added without forming cycles.

Constraints:

1 ≤ V ≤ 10^3
0 ≤ E ≤ (V*(V-1))/2
0 ≤ edges[i][0], edges[i][1] < V */

class Solution {
    public int maxEdgesToAdd(int V, int[][] edges) {
        // Code here
        int existing = edges.length;
        int maxPossible = V * (V - 1) / 2;
        int res = maxPossible - existing;
        
        return res;
    }
}
