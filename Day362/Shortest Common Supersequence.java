/* Shortest Common Supersequence
Given two strings s1 and s2, find the length of the smallest string which has both s1 and s2 as its sub-sequences.
Note: s1 and s2 can have both uppercase and lowercase English letters.

Examples:

Input: s1 = "geek", s2 = "eke"
Output: 5
Explanation: String "geeke" has both string "geek" and "eke" as subsequences.

Input: s1 = "AGGTAB", s2 = "GXTXAYB"
Output: 9
Explanation: String "AGXGTXAYB" has both string "AGGTAB" and "GXTXAYB" as subsequences.

Input: s1 = "geek", s2 = "ek"
Output: 4
Explanation: String "geek" has both string "geek" and "ek" as subsequences.

Constraints:

1 ≤ s1.size(), s2.size() ≤ 500 */

class Solution {
    public static int minSuperSeq(String s1, String s2) {
        // code here
        int m = s1.length();
        int n = s2.length();
        int [][]dp = new int[m+1][n+1];
        
        for(int i=1;i<=m;i++){
            for(int j=1;j<=n;j++){
                if(s1.charAt(i-1) == s2.charAt(j-1)){
                    dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i-1][j-1];
                }else{
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]);
                }
            }
        }
        int lcsLength = dp[m][n];
        
        return m + n - lcsLength;
    }
}
